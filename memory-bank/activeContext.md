## Current Work Focus
The project has been initially set up with both frontend and backend components. Recent work involved fixing issues according to the project checklist and resolving runtime errors:

1. Backend folder structure was reorganized
2. Django settings were updated to include REST framework and CORS headers
3. Contact form app was created with models, views, and serializers
4. Framer Motion integration was added to the frontend
5. Metadata was set up in the frontend
6. Fixed frontend and backend errors to get the project running

## Recent Changes

- Added REST framework and CORS headers to Django settings
- Configured PostgreSQL database in Django settings
- Created ContactSubmission model and API endpoint
- Added Framer Motion animations to the frontend
- Set up metadata in the HTML head
- Fixed database configuration for local development
- Added a root URL pattern to resolve Django's 404 error

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- Currently using SQLite for local development but will switch to PostgreSQL for production
- Considering adding form validation library to frontend
- Evaluating options for managing environment variables
- Exploring options for file uploads if needed in the future

### UX Considerations
- Need to ensure animations are subtle and enhance rather than distract
- Form feedback needs to be clear and accessible
- Mobile experience needs to be carefully tested and optimized
- Loading states should be implemented for better user experience

### Security Considerations
- CSRF protection is implemented but needs thorough testing
- Need to evaluate authentication options if adding protected content
- Rate limiting should be implemented to prevent abuse
- Input validation must be robust on both frontend and backend
