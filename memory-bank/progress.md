# Progress: QuantumFix Website

## What Works
- ✅ Project structure with separate frontend and backend
- ✅ Django backend with REST framework and admin interface
- ✅ Frontend with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Contact form functionality in frontend
- ✅ API endpoint for contact form submissions
- ✅ Basic Framer Motion animations
- ✅ Email configuration for auto-responses
- ✅ CORS and CSRF protection
- ✅ Basic responsive design
- ✅ Root URL pattern in Django to avoid 404 errors
- ✅ Proper CSS import order in frontend
- ✅ RevealSection component for animations

## What's Left to Build
- ⬜ More comprehensive animations using Framer Motion
- ⬜ Enhanced form validation with better error handling
- ⬜ Loading states for async operations
- ⬜ Unit and integration tests
- ⬜ Production deployment configuration
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline
- ⬜ SEO optimizations
- ⬜ Performance optimizations
- ⬜ Enhanced admin customization
- ⬜ Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Current Status
The project has met the basic requirements outlined in the checklist. The frontend and backend are set up and can communicate with each other. The contact form can submit data to the Django backend, which processes it and sends an auto-response email.

Local development is working with:
- Frontend running on http://localhost:5173/
- Backend running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Known Issues
1. **PostgreSQL Connection**: Local PostgreSQL connection may require password configuration adjustments - SQLite can be used for local development
2. ~~**Framer Motion Integration**: RevealSection component needs to be created or restored if deleted~~ - FIXED
3. **Frontend Directory Structure**: The frontend code is in 'animated-business-hub' instead of directly in 'frontend'
4. **Email Configuration**: Email sending works but may need SMTP configuration for production
5. **API Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place but needs enhancement
6. **Form Validation**: Basic validation exists but could be more comprehensive
7. **Testing**: No automated tests are currently implemented
8. **Deployment**: No production deployment configuration yet
9. **Environment Variables**: Production environment variables need to be set up
10. **Documentation**: API documentation could be improved

## Prioritized Backlog
1. Fix PostgreSQL connection issues
2. Implement proper Framer Motion animations
3. Enhance form validation and error handling
4. Add loading states for form submission
5. Implement unit and integration tests
6. Configure production deployment
7. Optimize performance and SEO
8. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
9. Enhance admin customization
10. Improve documentation
